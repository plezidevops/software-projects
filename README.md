Today I covered a lot. Too much for the mind to comsume in one day. But the learning was so cool I couldn't stop. I learned the importance of collaboration when designing a piece of software. Every body needs to work together to ensure the project is successful. The product owner collaborates with the development team and the customer. The development team collobarsates with the testers and system administrator. The team colloborates/work together and priotizing which stories to work on that best fit the project goal. JIRA plays a huge in unify the team regarless of your geographic location. This is amazing!
